<p>Like looking into the night sky, each day shows us a new star. A new discovery into the infinite well of knowledge, beauty and love that we try to fill as we walk through the journey of our lives...<br />
If no one stops to appreciate and remember each star, they fade into the darkness - worthless, like the grains of sand that we walk on.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Home is not a place, it is people."<br />
- Lois McMaster</p></blockquote>
<p>... As I journey through life, join me in seeing grains of sand that make the journey bearable and the stars that make my nights colorful.</p>
