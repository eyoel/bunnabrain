This is my initial post during the transition from wordpress to jekyll. I'll be working on moving my site from the wordpress [BunnaBrains][jekyll-docs] sight over to GitHub Pages.



Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

[old-site]: https://bunnabrains.com
[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/
