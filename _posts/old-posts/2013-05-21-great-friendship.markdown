> In memory of my amazing college family.

To the friends that surround me,    
always bringing me joy and laughter.    
I can't believe how far we've come,    
How high we've climbed the ladder.    

Without my friends I couldn't do it!    
you keep me going, you keep me grounded.    
"To go fast, go alone,    
But to go far, go surrounded"    

Though another year has gone by,    
And we get ready to close this chapter,    
Our friendship is a never-ending book,    
Which I will cherish forever after.    

Wherever and whenever it may be,    
the limits of our friendship are unchartered.    
You are always welcome in my home,    
And my help will always come unfaltered.
