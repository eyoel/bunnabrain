Today, we entered the city of Agra filled with lots of expectations, and thankfully the Taj did not disappoint. Its romantic history, it's amazing craftsmanship and the pure magnificence of its beauty leaves you in awe. Even as you enter the gates you are struck by its beauty. When you are standing beneath it, the intricacy that went into each handmade marble slab is amazing. Shahjahan himself said

Of course as always, the city surrounding the Taj is like another world. We try and enjoy our ricksha ride to the hotel and not stress about the fact that all the other rickshaws are rioting on strike. We were able to pose for a funny picture, while other rickshaw drivers were shouting insults at our driver for not respecting the strike.
