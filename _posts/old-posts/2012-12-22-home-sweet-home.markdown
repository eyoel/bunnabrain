As we arrived in Nagpur after a 12 hour train ride, our bodies were soar from the long trip and our minds were exhausted from the long spiritual journey of the north. Since my back was hurting and the stench fromt he socks of the guy infront of me wouldn't let me sleep, I decided to ponder. We had travelled to almost every religious temple, monastery,  mosque and church. The one thing they all had in common was the atmosphere of peace and serenity that filled each of them, followed by the crazy commotion and disorder that existed in the city life surrounding these religious conclaves. I left feeling bitter that such wonderful places of worship and meditation were so inclosed by chaos and filth.  If only the peace from within these religious places could spread to the entire cities.

But our hearts were at peace now! we we were home. The growing city of Nagpur was home to Pranay and therefore us. For the first time in days, we got to eat home cooked food and socialize with warm, welcoming family members. It was very nostalgic of home to continuously be offered food even though you had just eaten enough food for the whole day. All the family and friends we went to visit extended the same generosity. Another reminder of home to see many people had extending family or grandparents living with them at home, as the concept of retirement homes are foreign and family always takes care of family.

I finally got to ride on a moped, as we toured around Nagpur's different nooks and corners, checking out what the city had to see. It was very nice to see that not all of India's cities are as crowded and filled with traffic as Delhi was. We get to kick back and relax for the next two days.   
Quote of the day:

<blockquote>

"Life is like a Toblerone bar. When I was a kid, one piece of the bar used to excite me so much! I would read the letter on it and eat it slowly for hours. Now, I eat the whole chocolate bars like it is a peace of bread and think nothing of it."
