My country Ethiopia,   
you are my inspiration.   
the mother of many pioneers   
the creators of many inventions.   
From [Menelik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelik_II) to [Haile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I),   
Your children have give others motivation.   
Showing me how it can be done,   
giving me the dedication.   
   
you've carried the burden of our people,   
without tears or frustration   
You've survived many a [trouble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983%E2%80%931985_famine_in_Ethiopia)   
Through unity and determination.   
Now when you are stumbling once again,   
You call " children, come fill your expectations!"   
"Come back to me! " you cry   
calling your children in desperation.   
That once fertile and prosperous Abysinnia,   
Now filled with sorrow and desolation.   
"Come back to me!" you cry   
begging your children for redemption.   
   
You've given them so much,   
But they have all fled into migration.   
those once proud and patriotic,   
Now infected by sorrow and depression.   
Your bleeding veins of knowledge   
Now being drained of its education.   
Leaving your fields empty and crops dying,   
No one to fill your vacant job positions.   
   
   
Who will come and rescue you now?   
Who will be your salvation?   
Can they hear you cry?   
Will they feel your devastation?
