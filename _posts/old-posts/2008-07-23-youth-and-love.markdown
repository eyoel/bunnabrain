We all have to grow up   
No one can escape responsibility.   
Life gets tougher and tougher,   
To survive we need maturity.   
WE can’t always be oblivious,   
We get struck hard by reality.   

But when we’re merely children,   
Like kids of the age three,   
We have nothing to worry us,   
Just jump and be free.   
Enjoying every moment   
Of that life without penalty.   
Whether doing wrong or right   
Always treated kindly.   

Now as I grow up   
My eyes begin to see   
The world for what it is,   
A place with no equality.   

To survive we have to change,   
Becoming things we don’t want to be.   
Circumstance makes me do,   
Things I don’t want done to me.   

But when I was feeling like my life,   
Was being washed out by the sea.   
One day this beautiful thing   
Just came and rescued me.   

She threw me a lifeline,   
And saved my entire personality   
From turning into a monster,   
From losing all morality.   
She gave me back love,   
She brought back the youth in me.   

Like the child I was,   
I can jump and be free!   
I’ve become innocent at mind,   
And want this feeling for eternity.   
I can now rest my thoughts,   
Because she is with me.   

She completed my life   
And created tranquility.   
For love & youth go hand in hand   
And she created their harmony.   
Now my life’s only demand   
Is to get her in love with me.
