As the driver speeds up the unguarded mountain side roads, honking his horn as we make sharp turns on paths that look like they can only fit one car, I wonder if I will die from the drive up and down the mountain or from the flight down the mountain as we paraglide. The excitement of getting to see the view of the landscape from the sky and the old classical Hindi music the driver is playing console my fears and keep me eagerly awaiting my first flight over the Himalayas.
