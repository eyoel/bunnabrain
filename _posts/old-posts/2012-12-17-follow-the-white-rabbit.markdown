Today we travel in search of the Himalayas. As our journey started, the people we met looked like they were from Aladdin with their turbans and long beards.

And as we continued, the people got sparse and the road got worse but there was no sign of the himalayas or the white topped skyscrapers that we came looking for. 

After many hours of bad, winding roads, seeing baboons and much suspense, there was a spark of hope. We could finally started to regain faith in the snow. Beautiful white mounds hidden begin clouds, high in the sky.  We are almost there!
