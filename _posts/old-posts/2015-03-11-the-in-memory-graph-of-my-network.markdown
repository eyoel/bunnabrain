I realize how important it is to keep a strong, well connected graph of your social network. Because honestly, your social network is also your business network when you want to get a project up and running!

When I look back at all the people I have worked with in the past, my most successful projects and the ones I've enjoyed the most were the ones where I was working with close friends.

Cool intersection between tech and fun project ideas: I would like to construct a graph of my current friend circle and visualize it. Then find a way to strengthen these relationships through constantly adding edges wherever possible; introducing friends that might find it beneficial and making new friends where possible. If we really think about it, we all have a big in-memory graph of our social networks.. in our brains! Getting a computer to offload/store some of that information and help to analyze it wouldn't hurt :)

Some times I find it hard to keep in touch with everyone, as we keep on adding new friends here and there.

It would be interesting to see how to identify the closest relationships and the ones that have been getting weak. This kind of analysis would be a nice way to help me keep in touch with those friends that I value a lot but sometimes lose contact with because they are not so close bye.

more to be added to this in the near future.
