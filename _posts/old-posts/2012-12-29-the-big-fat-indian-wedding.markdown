I used to always wonder how Hindus and Buddhists could live off of vegetarian food, but today, I have come to understand.
This extremely extravagant wedding had the largest buffet setup I had seen in my life! There was enough food to feed thousands! An Ethiopian would be shocked since the only two things that you are guaranteed to find in an Ethiopian wedding are very absent - meat and alcohol. As a pure carnivore, it was amazing to see the impossible happen, hundreds of delicious dishes made without the use of a single bit of meat.
It was also wonderful to see all the colorful dress that has made me admire India's distinct love for colors and art. There were hand painters , fortune tellers and many other entertainers in addition to the unbelievable amounts of food.
If everyone spent this kind of money on weddings, I don't know how people could afford life.
Beautiful women in dresses and men in their suits. It's funny how men's culture has changed but women still wear traditional.

As we walked around enjoying the food and music, there was talk  about the of the two families. Difference between class is still very prevalent, but it almost feels like a person's level of education has become the new measure of status.  The hot gossip in many corners is wether the couple matches up and what level of education they have.
Bhavna's mom mentioned,


<blockquote>
"when two people get married, it's not about the union of the couple, it's about the union of their families"
</blockquote>


and here you can see as the different sides are getting to know each other.
