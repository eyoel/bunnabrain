As the sun sets on the white mountains turning them to a radiant red, we are still unsure of where we will sleep the night. We continue up the steeper and steeper mountains in search of the monasteries the dalilama's office had recommended.  The search for nirvana had begun. 

After finding information on the monasteries and traveling down the winding and dangerous stairs that travel down into the depths of the jungle, we are met by the most welcoming people I have met so far. They invite us into their home and the manager is called from a 30min distance to find us space. The director then explains the Buddhism, voyage to nirvana and what all the monks are studying and working towards. He tells us there are many roads to nirvana and we can work in many ways to reach it.

When we leave to find dinner, we are shocked by the flashing lights and dazzling tourist attractions that fills the city of McLeod  Ganj. The lavish looking life style, that could be straight from a james bond movie. All the confused looking tourists and Indians asking you for drugs. There truly are, many paths to the pursuit of nirvana.
