Hard to give, hard to get,   
To earn someone’s trust,   
You will lose a lot of sweat.   
Even if you want to give it   
To every person you have met,   
You can only give it to the people,   
That you know you won’t forget.   
With the trust of a loved one   
I don’t advise you bet.   
Because trust, once lost   
Can only leave you in regret.
