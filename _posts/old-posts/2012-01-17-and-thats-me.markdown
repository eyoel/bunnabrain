Looking at that far away mountain,   
Hiding the early morning light,   
Reaching that point and climbing,   
To the top peak is my delight.   
Not only my favorite exercise,   
But also my way of life.   
I set my goals high out of reach,   
And try to get there with all my might.   
Like the African lions of Ethiopia,   
Watching over all those in my sight.   

In the words of the great Gandhi,   
"Be the change you wish to see"   
So tell the kids I'll be coming,   
To bring brightness in the form of electricity.   
Empowering children across the globe,   
Like the heroes of a Morgan Freeman movie.   
Fight for your dreams while savoring today,   
Is my life's recipe.   
If you're feeling a little stressed,   
Listening to music to find serenity.   
Enjoying time with the wonderful friends,   
And watching great shows like Community
