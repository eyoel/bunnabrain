To my precious little bunny,   
That's always up to no good.   
You add the much needed honey,   
To our tedious battle with books.   

I probably should have called you sunny   
Since days spent with you are always bright.   
Though it would have been funny,   
I'm not sure it would be quite right.   
Though you are my ray of happiness,   
I'm not sure you fill everyone's day with light. Â :)   
But that's why you're my bunny   
And only for this rabbit does my heart delight   

Your cheerfulness never leaves me,   
And your place in my heart is marked in stone.   
The way I feel about you never changes   
Not even if it doesn't show.   
Being in this foreign place,   
Where very few ever understand.   
Though at times we travel our own ways,   
I will be beside you with an open hand.   
Though our paths don't always go together,   
Our friendship should always stand.   
Whether from slippery ice or bad days,   
You've got a friend in which to depend.
