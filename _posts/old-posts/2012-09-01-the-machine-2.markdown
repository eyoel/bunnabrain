In this 21st Century,   
where everything is electronic,   
we can't lose sight of   
what actually brightens our planet.   
   
The machines at our side,   
engineers create to empower us   
have become scary monsters,   
starting to devour us!   
Eating up all our time,   
making people slave over ones and zeros   
many programmers have been kept,   
sitting at their desk, not leaving their bureaus.   
   
But I know that there's more,   
and this machine can't be so terrible,   
we can use it for good,   
and bring change that 's incomparable.   
we can bring people together,   
and help make their problems more bearable.   
   
I must also thank this machine,   
for all it's work and splendor.   
because without python & java,   
I would not have met you this summer!   
so to the slayer of this monster,   
the cheerful engineer reading this letter,   
please only make great electronics,   
that will make human life better.
