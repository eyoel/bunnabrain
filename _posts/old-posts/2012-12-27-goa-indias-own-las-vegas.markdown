Now, we leave the big and crowded streets of Mumbai to get a suntan on the beaches of Goa! I had been told so much about this place was, I was not sure what to expect.

We had been traveling for so long, the only thing I wanted to do today was relax. And that was exactly what we did. The Calangute beach was filled from end to end with small shacks that where blasting party music and serving cold drinks by their sunbeds and umbrellas. After a quick dip in the water, I laid down and enjoyed the sunset with my feet in the ground. This was definitely the place to relax and have a good time.

Later in the evening, we went out to see what all the talk about Goa's parties was about. Very close to Baga Beach, there was street after street of bars, pubs and clubs. There was a particularly lively street called Tito's where we met up with the one and only Neeraj to celebrate his birthday! It was a wonderful night of fun and surprise, as there were more European people around than I have seen at even IIT!
